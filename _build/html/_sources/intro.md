# Stochastic Growth and Long-Run Risk 

This notebook provides two computational examples for {cite:ts}`hansen2021risk`.

The first example concerns an AK model with adjustment cost, with capital and endogenous long-run risk. The model is inspired in part by {cite:ts}`eberly2009capital`, but includes a habit persistence process for technology.

In the second example, we consider Friedman's permanent income model with habit persistence preferences, motivated by {cite:ts}`hansen1999robust`.

Both models are solved approximately using small noise expansion technique, as in {cite:ts}`lombardo2018theory`.

This notebook is mainly for illustrating model specific results. For more general computation details, users can refer to the complementary Computational Details notebook.
